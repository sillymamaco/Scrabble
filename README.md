# Scrabble
Project made for Foundations of Programming (1st semester, hence the colaborator). Made a fork so i can continue to tweak and improve it to my liking.
I added translation support (for english and french, besides the original european portuguese, as these are the languages I am familiar with) after I finished the class and also tweaked the vocabulary files to be wider.
Might add a UI that isnt on the terminal.
